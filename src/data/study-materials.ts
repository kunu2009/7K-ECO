        summary: "Economics is divided into Microeconomics, which studies individual economic units like households and firms, and Macroeconomics, which examines the economy as a whole, including aggregates like inflation, unemployment, and national income. Microeconomics uses a slicing method, focusing on price theory and individual behavior. Macroeconomics uses a lumping method, focusing on income theory and aggregate variables. Both branches are interdependent and crucial for understanding the complexities of economic systems.",

        summary: "Utility analysis is a cornerstone of consumer behavior theory. It defines 'utility' as the want-satisfying power of a commodity. The core concept is the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility (DMU), which states that the additional satisfaction (marginal utility) a consumer gets from consuming successive units of a commodity goes on diminishing. This law, proposed by Alfred Marshall, is based on assumptions of rationality, cardinal measurement of utility, and continuous consumption. It has significant practical applications in explaining the paradox of value, forming the basis for the law of demand, and guiding fiscal policy.",

        summary: "Demand analysis focuses on understanding consumer behavior. 'Demand' is the desire for a commodity backed by the ability and willingness to pay for it. The Law of Demand states an inverse relationship between a commodity's price and its quantity demanded, ceteris paribus. This is why the demand curve slopes downwards. Demand is influenced by several determinants besides price, including income, tastes, prices of substitute and complementary goods, and expectations. A change in price causes a movement along the demand curve, while a change in any other determinant causes a shift in the entire curve. 'Elasticity of Demand' measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in one of its determinants, most commonly price. It can be elastic (responsive), inelastic (unresponsive), or unitary.",

        summary: "Supply analysis examines the behavior of producers. 'Supply' refers to the quantity of a commodity that a producer is willing and able to offer for sale at a given price. The Law of Supply posits a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied, meaning producers are willing to sell more at higher prices. This results in an upward-sloping supply curve. A change in price causes a movement along the supply curve (expansion or contraction), while changes in other determinants—such as technology, input prices, or government policies—cause the entire curve to shift (increase or decrease). The concept of 'Cost and Revenue' is central, with Total Cost (TC), Average Cost (AC), and Marginal Cost (MC) influencing supply decisions. Revenue concepts include Total Revenue (TR), Average Revenue (AR), and Marginal Revenue (MR). Producers aim to maximize profit, which is the difference between total revenue and total cost.",

Perfect Competition features a large number of buyers and sellers, a homogeneous product, free entry and exit, and perfect knowledge; firms are price takers.

Oligopoly is characterized by a few dominant firms whose decisions are interdependent, often leading to strategic behavior like price wars or collusion.

There are three main methods to measure it: the Output or Production Method (summing up the net value added by all producing units), the Income Method (summing up all factor incomes like rent, wages, interest, and profit), and the Expenditure Method (summing up all final expenditure on consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports). Key concepts include Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Gross National Product (GNP), Net National Product (NNP), and Per Capita Income. Difficulties in measurement arise from issues like the black economy, non-monetized transactions, and obtaining reliable data.",

        summary: "Foreign trade involves the exchange of goods and services between countries. It is composed of exports (goods sold to other countries) and imports (goods bought from other countries). The 'Composition of foreign trade' refers to the types of goods and services being traded, while the 'Direction of foreign trade' refers to the countries we trade with. The Balance of Payments (BOP) is a systematic record of all economic transactions between residents of a country and the rest of the world over a period. It has two main components: the Current Account (which records trade in goods and services, and transfer payments) and the Capital Account (which records transactions in financial assets). Understanding these concepts is crucial for analyzing a country's external economic health.",
