                { text: "A poor person buys more of a low-quality bread (bajra) when its price rises.", marks: 2, answer: "<b>Concept:</b> Giffen's Paradox.<br/><b>Explanation:</b> A Giffen good is a special type of inferior good where demand increases as the price rises. This happens because the negative income effect of a price rise for a staple food is stronger than the substitution effect, forcing poor consumers to buy more of it as they can no longer afford better alternatives." },
                { text: "The government of India has borrowed from the World Bank.", marks: 2, answer: "<b>Concept:</b> Public Debt (specifically External Debt).<br/><b>Explanation:</b> Public debt refers to the total borrowings of the government. When the government borrows from foreign entities like the World Bank or other countries, it is known as external debt." },
                { text: "A consumer buys more of a product at a high price because of its status symbol.", marks: 2, answer: "<b>Concept:</b> Veblen Goods or Prestige Goods.<br/><b>Explanation:</b> These are luxury goods for which demand increases as the price increases. This is an exception to the law of demand because the high price itself is a marker of status and exclusivity, making the good more desirable." },
                { text: "A country's imports of goods are valued at $500 billion, while its exports of goods are $400 billion.", marks: 2, answer: "<b>Concept:</b> Unfavourable Balance of Trade or Trade Deficit.<br/><b>Explanation:</b> Balance of Trade measures the difference between the value of a country's visible exports and visible imports. When imports are greater than exports, it results in a trade deficit, which is considered unfavourable." },
                { text: "A new technology is introduced that reduces the cost of producing mobile phones.", marks: 2, answer: "<b>Concept:</b> Increase in Supply.<br/><b>Explanation:</b> An improvement in technology is a key determinant of supply. It lowers the cost of production, making it more profitable for firms to produce. This leads to an increase in the quantity supplied at every price level, causing the supply curve to shift to the right." },

                { text: "Perfect Competition and Monopoly", marks: 2, answer: "<b>Perfect Competition:</b> 1) Large number of sellers. 2) Firms are price takers.<br/><b>Monopoly:</b> 1) Single seller. 2) The firm is a price maker." },

                { text: "Explain the features of Utility.", marks: 4, answer: "1. <b>Relative Concept:</b> Utility is related to time and place. Woolen clothes have utility in winter but not summer. <br/> 2. <b>Subjective Concept:</b> It is a psychological concept and differs from person to person. A book may have utility for a student but not for an illiterate person. <br/> 3. <b>Ethically Neutral:</b> The concept of utility has no ethical consideration. A commodity has utility if it satisfies a want, regardless of whether it is morally right or wrong (e.g., a knife has utility for a chef and a killer). <br/> 4. <b>Utility differs from Usefulness:</b> A commodity may have utility but may not be useful. For example, cigarettes have utility for a smoker but are harmful to health." },
                { text: "Explain the determinants of Supply.", marks: 4, answer: "1. <b>Price of the Commodity:</b> This is the most important factor. According to the Law of Supply, more is supplied at a higher price and less at a lower price. <br/> 2. <b>State of Technology:</b> Improvements in technology reduce the cost of production and lead to an increase in supply. <br/> 3. <b>Cost of Production / Input Prices:</b> If the price of inputs like labor or raw materials rises, the cost of production increases, leading to a decrease in supply. <br/> 4. <b>Government Policies:</b> Favourable policies like subsidies reduce production costs and increase supply, while unfavourable policies like taxes increase costs and decrease supply." },
                { text: "Explain the features of Oligopoly.", marks: 4, answer: "1. <b>Few Firms or Sellers:</b> The market is dominated by a small number of large firms. <br/> 2. <b>Interdependence:</b> This is the most important feature. Since there are few firms, the actions of one firm (regarding price or output) directly affect the others, leading to reactions. <br/> 3. <b>Advertising:</b> Firms engage in aggressive advertising and sales promotion to attract customers and increase market share. <br/> 4. <b>Barriers to Entry:</b> There are significant barriers that prevent new firms from entering the market, such as economies of scale, patents, or control over raw materials." },
                { text: "Explain the components of the government budget.", marks: 4, answer: "The government budget has two main components: Revenue Budget and Capital Budget. <br/> 1. <b>Revenue Receipts:</b> These are government receipts that do not create a liability or reduce an asset. They include Tax Revenue (e.g., income tax, GST) and Non-Tax Revenue (e.g., fees, fines). <br/> 2. <b>Revenue Expenditure:</b> This is recurring government spending that does not create assets, such as salaries, pensions, and subsidies. <br/> 3. <b>Capital Receipts:</b> These receipts either create a liability (like borrowings) or reduce an asset (like disinvestment). <br/> 4. <b>Capital Expenditure:</b> This is government spending that creates assets, like building roads, hospitals, or purchasing machinery." },
                { text: "Explain the functions of the RBI.", marks: 4, answer: "1. <b>Issuer of Currency:</b> RBI has the sole right to issue currency notes of all denominations except one-rupee notes and coins. <br/> 2. <b>Banker to the Government:</b> It acts as a banker, agent, and advisor to the central and state governments. It manages their accounts and public debt. <br/> 3. <b>Bankers' Bank:</b> RBI acts as the bank for all commercial banks. It holds their cash reserves and acts as a lender of last resort. <br/> 4. <b>Controller of Credit:</b> RBI controls the money supply and credit in the economy through its monetary policy tools like Repo rate, CRR, and SLR to maintain price stability." },
